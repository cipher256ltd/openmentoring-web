##Effects
At the time of a traumatic event, the person experiencing the event might feel numb and unable to respond.
<br>
Immediately after a traumatic event, it is common for people to feel shocked, or dazed, or unable to process their own feelings.
<br>
Over several hours or days, the feelings of shock and denial gradually fade, and other thoughts and feelings take their place.
<br>
People react differently and take different amounts of time to come to terms with a traumatic event. Even so, you may be surprised by the strength of your feelings.
<br>
##Feelings you might have after a traumatic event
After an emergency or traumatic event, you may feel:
<br>
Frightened — that the same thing will happen again, or that you might lose control of your feelings and break down
<br>
Helpless - that something really bad happened and you could do nothing about it. 
<br>
Angry — about what has happened and with whoever was responsible
<br>
Guilty — that you have survived when others have suffered or died
<br>
Sad - particularly if people were injured or killed, especially someone you knew.
<br>
Ashamed or embarrassed — that you have these strong feelings you can’t control, especially if you need others to support you
<br>
Relieved - that danger is over and that the danger has gone.
<br>
Hopeful - that your life will return to normal. People can start to feel more positive about things quite soon after a trauma.
<br>
Strong feelings affect your physical health. In the weeks after a trauma, you may find that you:
-Cannot sleep
-Feel very tired
-Dream a lot and have nightmares
<br>
-Have poor concentration
-Have memory problems
-Have difficulty thinking clearly
-Suffer from headaches
<br>
-Experiences change in appetite
-Experiences changes in sex-drive or libido
-Have aches and pains
-Feel that your heart is beating faster.
<Br>
It may take weeks for some of these feelings and symptoms to pass. Remember that these are normal reactions to extreme circumstances. They are not signs that you are week or sick.
<br>

##Coping strategies for traumatic stress
Everyone has natural ways of coping. Encourage people to use their own positive coping strategies.
<br>
This will help them feel stronger and regain a sense of control. You will need to adapt the following suggestions to take account of the persons culture and what is possible in the particular crisis situation.
<br>

<br>

##What is traumatic stress
Journalists and human rights defenders do difficult and challenging work ,and see a good deal of human misery. We may even be fearful for our lives at times. It is therefore imprint to know how to react following a traumatic event, and how to recognise the symptoms of traumatic stress.
<br>
Any event which is very distressing and outside of the realm of normal human experience can result in traumatic stress. Traumatic stress usually produces a very intense response, including fear and/or helplessness, which may overwhelm the individual’s coping mechanisms.
<br>
Such a response is a normal reaction to an abnormal situation.

##What is post-traumatic stress disorder
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) develops in about 1 in 3 people who experience severe trauma.
<br>
Certain factors such as if you or your family have had depression or anxiety in the past, or you don’t receive much support from family or friends, can make you more susceptible to developing PTSD after a traumatic event.
<br>
In most cases, PTSD develops during the first month after a traumatic event. However, in a minority of cases, there may be a delay of months or even years before symptoms start to appear. 

## Learn
##Effects
The specific symptoms of PTSD can vary widely between individuals, but they generally fall into the categories described in the following cards.
<br>
These symptoms are often severe and persistent and enough to have a significant impact on the person’s day-to-day life.
<br>
**Re-experiencing**
Re-experiencing is the most typical symptom of PTSD. This is when a person involuntarily and vividly re-lives the traumatic event in the form of flashbacks, nightmares or repetitive and distressing images or sensations.
<br>This can even include physical sensations such s pain, sweating and trembling or negative thoughts about their experience. 
<br>
**Avoidance**
Trying to avoid being reminded of the traumatic event is another key symptom of PTSD.
<br>
This usually means avoiding certain people or places that remind you of the trauma, or avoiding talking to anyone about your experience. Many people with PTSD try distraction themselves with work or hobbies.
<br>
Some people attempt to deal with their feelings by trying not to feel anything at all, which can lead to the person becoming isolated and withdrawn.
<br>
**Feeling on edge**
Someone with PTSD may be very anxious and find it difficult to relax. They may be constantly aware of threats and easily startled.
<br>
This state of mind is known s hyper-arousal. Hyper-arousal often leads to irritability, angry outburst, sleeping problems (insomnia) and difficulty concentrating.
<br>
**Other problems**
Many people with PTSD also have a number of other problems, including:
- depression, anxiety and phobias
- drug misuse or alcohol misuse 
- headaches, dizziness, chest pains and stomach aches
- PTSD sometimes leads to work-related problems and the breakdown of relationships.

##What is of chronic stress?
Chronic stress occurs regularly among journalists and human rights defenders, yet often goes unrecognised or unreported.
<br>
With healthy levels of stress, symptoms are generally mild and temporary - people return to functioning when the stress factor is removed.
<br>
If exposure to stress is excessive or long-term however, symptoms can persist and multiply, resulting in chronic or cumulative stress. 
<br>
Not only is this worse for the body physically and mentally, but chronic stress can also erode coping mechanisms. 
<br>
Chronic stress builds slowly and may be hard to notice in yourself or others. If not properly manged, chronic stress can lead to burnout.
