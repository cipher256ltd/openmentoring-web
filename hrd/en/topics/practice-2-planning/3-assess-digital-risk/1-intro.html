## Introduction
<p>In order to know what measures to take in order to be more secure, both digitally and in our day-to-day personal and professional activities, it&#39;s important to understand the nature of the risk we face, so that we can make the right decisions about how best to stay safe.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Perhaps without realising, we take decisions based on risk analyses every day. <strong>For example:</strong> you may choose not to walk home through a particular neighbourhood you consider dangerous, or to lock your office doors when you leave in the evening, to deter thieves. The idea of this section is to consider that same logic, as it applies to our digital activities, both as Journalists and as private people.</p>
