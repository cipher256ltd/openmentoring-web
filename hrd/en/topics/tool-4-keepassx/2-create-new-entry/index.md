Learn about the various elements in a KeePassX entry.

The Add Entry window presents you with a number of fields to be completed. None of these fields are mandatory; information submitted here is largely for your own convenience.

A brief explanation of the text fields and elements in a KeePassX entry is presented as follows: - Group: KeePassX lets you sort your passwords into pre-defined groups. For example: 'Internet' would be a good place to store passwords that relate to website accounts. Click on the drop-down menu to choose a group. - Icon: The icon that will be associated with this account entry. If you click on the icon button, you can see the icons available in the Icon Selection window. You also have the option to add a custom icon by clicking on the ’Add Custom Icon’ button in the bottom left of the Icon Selection window. To select one of the KeePassX icons available, click the Pick button in the bottom right of the window.

Step 3: Create a new KeePassX entry for your RiseUp account within the Internet Group in your KeePassX database. Select Internet from the Group dropdown menu. Then enter the account information for your RiseUp account.

Step 4: Click {OK} to save your changes to the Add Entry screen.


## Edit an existing entry
# Step 1. 
Select the ’Internet’ Group in the database menu on the left side of the window to see the entries associated with it.

Step 2. In this example, we’ll use the Riseup account entry we created in Step 4.1 above. Within the ’Internet’ Group, Select the Riseup entry we created by clicking it within the list of entries inside the ’Internet’ Group (at the moment, it’s the only entry in your new KeePassX database, but eventually your database will have many entries within each group).

Step 3. There are three ways to open up the entry in order to edit it.
Option 1. You can ‘right click’ on the selected entry by holding down the Control key and clicking the entry, which activates a menu of options.Then scroll down and click on View/Edit Entry.

Option 2. In the KeePassX menu, select Entries, then New Database.

Option 3. Use the View/Edit Entry shortcut key combination: Command-E.

Step 4. With an open entry, you can add new information or edit any existing information, including the password. (In this example, we’ll add some additional information to the Comment field.) To save your changes, click {OK}.

Note: Remember that making changes to a KeePassX entry only updates that entry in your KeePassX database. It does not automatically update corresponding information elsewhere, such as a new password for an online account, or the same KeePassX entry in any copies or backups of your KeePassX database that you have saved elsewhere. Therefore, you will need to make any relevant updates to your account information, as well as new KeePassX database backups and copies seperately after editing your entry here.
