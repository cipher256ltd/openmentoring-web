## Introduction

<br>
This unit gives you recommendations on what to do after an emergency has happened. This is a very important, but often forgotten, step in dealing with emergencies.

## Scenario
Isaac and Brenda had their office raided. They are in need of emergency funding to get their website running and new devices, and don't know who to ask.

<br>
Isaac feels he didn't do enough to prepare, and Brenda suggests they re-evaluate their emergency and security procedures. If they don't, they might face the same emergencies again soon.

## Emergency funding

Some organisations offer funding to individuals or organisations who have encountered an emergency as a result of their journalism or human rights work.
<br>
If you are in need of emergency funding, consider reaching out to [Frontline Defenders](https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en), [Digital Defenders Partnership](https://www.digitaldefenders.org/), [Reporters without Borders](https://rsf.org/en), the [Open Technology Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/), or [Pen International](www.pen-international.org/).

## Traumatic stress
![](recap.png)
Journalists and human rights defenders do difficult and challenging work, and see a good deal of human misery. We may even be fearful for our lives at times.
<br>
It is therefore important to know how to react following a traumatic event, and how to recognise the symptoms of traumatic stress.
<br>
Traumatic Stress is a normal reaction to an abnormal situation. It's very possible that after an emergency, you or your colleagues may be suffering from traumatic stress.
<br>
To learn about what traumatic stress is, how traumatic stress affects you, and how to deal with traumatic stress, refer to the [Your Well-Being](en/topics/understand-2-security/2-your-well-being/index.html) unit presented elsewhere in this tool.


## After an emergency

Now is a good time to go back to your emergency and security plans to see what worked and what did not.
<br>
When necessary, this would be a good time to try to improve your organisational procedures (e.g. procedures when on a mission or when organising a training.), determining the best practice of how to respond to an emergency or not.
<br>
This should be considered for all stages of an event or activity - in terms of preparation the implementation of an activity, and when an activity has ended.
<br>
For more information on what to do after an emergency has happened, you might find Protection International's [Protection Manual for Human Rights Defenders](https://protectioninternational.org/publications-protection-manual-for-human-rights-defenders/) useful.
