# Getting Started
<p>This topic is based on the <a href="http://digitaldefenders.org/digitalfirstaid/">Digital First Aid Kit</a> and aims to provide preliminary support for people facing the most common types of digital threats.</p>

***<p>This topic offers a set of self-diagnostic tools for human rights defenders, bloggers, activists and journalists facing attacks themselves.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It also provides guidelines for digital first responders to assist a person under threat.</p>

***<p>The Digital First Aid Kit is not meant to serve as the ultimate solution to all your digital emergencies. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>It strives to give you tools that can help you make a first assessment of what is happening and determine if you can mitigate the problem on your own. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>If at any moment you feel uncomfortable or unsure about implementing any of the solutions outlined here, ask for help from trained professionals.</p>
