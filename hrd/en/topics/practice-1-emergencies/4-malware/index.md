# Malware
## Determining whether you might have malware
Before you assume malware may be at play with your device, be sure your account has not been hijacked. Refer first to the section on [Account Hijacking](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/2-account-hijacked/1-intro.md).
<br>
After you have done this, come up with a list of indicators of compromise.


## What is malware?
Malware exploits access to your device to send out spam, seize banking, email or social media credentials, shut down websites and collect vital information from journalists, human rights defenders, NGOs, activists and bloggers.
<br>
Malware works by installing itself on your device when you open a link to a malicious website or open an infected file you have downloaded. After it is installed on your device, it can record keystrokes, steal passwords, take screenshots, record audio, video and more.
<br>
Malware is dangerous software that allows an unauthorized takeover of your device by another user. It can be used by the government or a third party to surveil you.
<br>
While most malware is designed for and utilized by criminals, people working directly or indirectly for governments have increasingly adopted malware as a tool for surveillance, espionage and sabotage.
<br>
With malware, the important thing you can do is prepare. Refer to the [Planning and Preparing](en/topics/practice-2-planning/0-getting-started/1-1-intro.md) unit to learn more about computer hygiene and developing emergency plans.


## Recommended anti-virus software
- Microsoft Safety Scanner (Windows)
- F-Secure
- Kaspersky
- ClamXav (Mac OS X)
- TrendMicro
- ClamAV (Windows and Linux)


## Using anti-virus software
When you run anti-virus software, ensure that it is up to date.
<br>
If a virus is detected the following 3-steps are recommended:
<br>
>Step 1:
# Take a screenshot of the message

<br>
>Step 2
# Continue with the recommended steps to remove the virus

<br>
>Step 3
# Following the guidelines in the [Safer Communication](en/topics/understand-4-digisec/4-secure-communications/1-intro.md) section, send the screenshot to a trusted person with security expertise


## 7 indicators of compromise
1. You opened an attachment or link that you think may have been malicious. Links or attachments are often the cause of malware infections.
<br>
2. Your webcam LED turns on when you are not using the webcam. This may indicate your device is being accessed remotely.
<br>
3. Your accounts have been compromised multiple times, even after you have changed the password. This may indicate someone has control of your device.
<br>
4. Your device was seized and then returned. It is possible that your device may have been infected with malware when it was taken from you.
<br>
5. Someone broke into your home and may have tampered with your device. This may indicate that your device was infected with malware during the break in.
<br>
6. Some of your personal data has been made public and it could only come from your personal computer. This may indicate that someone has access to your computer.
<br>
7. Your group is being targeted by a government, law enforcement, or an actor with equivalent capabilities.
<br>
If your device shows clear indicators of compromise and you have also determined that you are not the victim of [account hijacking](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/2-account-hijacked/1-1-intro.md), you can either 'let the attack play out' or 'clean' your device.


## Letting the attack play out
Your first priority may be to get your computer ‘clean’ and usable again. Finding out what has happened to you and who has targeted you may be less important to you. But it can be very valuable and empowering to gain understanding of your adversary through letting the attack play out.
<br>
If understanding the attacker and the attack is important to you, you must collect and analyse information when a potential malware infection happens. Do this before ‘cleaning’ your computer.


## &#39;Cleaning&#39; your device
If you chose to clean your device without letting the attack play out, please keep the following in mind:
<br>
There is no quick fix to clean up malware from you computer. [Anti-virus software](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/4-malware/3-9-learn.md) may be good at protecting your device from most malware, but it is generally considered ineffective against targeted attacks, especially by state-sponsored actors.
<br>
If you believe you are being targeted by the state, disconnect your device from the internet, turn it off, unplug it, remove the battery from your device and seek the help of a trusted security professional. Refer to your [Emergency Plans](en/topics/practice-2-planning/4-emergency-plan/1-1-intro.md).


## Anti-virus software
Anti-virus software can be good at protecting your devices from most malware. But it is generally considered ineffective against targeted attacks, especially by state-sponsored actors.
<br>
We recommend using anti-virus software because it is a valuable tool against non-targeted but still dangerous malware.
