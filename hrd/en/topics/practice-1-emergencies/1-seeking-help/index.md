# Seeking Remote Help
## Introduction
This section will provide you with guidance on ways to establish secure communication when reaching out for help when confronted with a potential digital attack.

## Scenario
Isaac is worried that his computer might have been hacked into. He wants to reach out to his friend Brenda who he things can advise her.
<br>
But Isaac is thinks that he might be at risk if he reveals too much about his situation, or worse, that he could put Brenda herself at risk if he doesn't use secure communications to reach out to her.

## Learn
As a general rule, it is important to understand that most ‘normal’ communications tools are not very secure against eavesdropping.
<br>
Mobile and landline phone communication is not encrypted and can be listened to by governments, law enforcement agencies, or other parties with the necessary technical equipment. 
<br>
Sending unencrypted communication is like sending a postcard, anyone who has access to the postcard can read the message. 
<br>
Sending encrypted communication is like placing the postcard inside a safe and then sending the safe, which only you and those you trust know the combination to and are able to open and read the message.

## Next
Do the best that you can with the resources and skills available.
<br>
Start with the most secure form of communication you can manage and the person you reach out to may be able to help you establish a line of communications that is more secure, if necessary. 
<br>
In many cases, it is better to reach out for help insecurely than not to reach out for help at all.
