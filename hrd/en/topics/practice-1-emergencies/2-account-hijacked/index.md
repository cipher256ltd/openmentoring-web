## Scenario
![](scenario.png)

Isaac just received an email from his service provider alerting him that his social media account password has recently changed. He suspects that his social media account has been hijacked.

He needs to know if he still has access to the account, and if not, who he can reach out to for help. Isaac is worried that if he doesn't regain control, his social media account will be used to hurt his reputation.


## Get back control of your account
Move to a different computer that you believe to be safe or uncompromised. If you continue using an unsafe computer, you risk putting yourself and others at harm.
<br>
Log into your account from the new computer and change the password on your account. Changing your password is the fastest way to regain control of your account.
<br>
Change the passwords for all your other online accounts that are linked to your hijacked account. For example, if you are looking at an email account and it is the recovery address for another account, change the password for that account as well.
<br>
Now time to confirm if your suspicions are founded? The next instructions will help you determine if your account has been hijacked.
<br>
Until you better understand the situation we recommend you stop using this account for sharing sensitive information.

> Remember to change passwords for your linked accounts!


## Confirm if your account has been hijacked
For some platforms (e.g. Facebook, Gmail), it is possible to review connection history and account activity. This will let you know if your account has been accessed by someone else.
<br>
Check to see if your account was accessed at a time when you were not online or if your account was accessed from an unfamiliar location or IP address.
<br>
Be mindful that if you are using the Tor browser or a VPN service, it is possible that the location or IP address may differ from the location you have accessed the platform.

## Other places to check for suspicious activity
>Step 1
#Email forwarding

Check for suspicious addresses which your email might be automatically forwarding your emails to.
<br>
>Step 2
#Password recovery

Also check email addresses or phone numbers listed when you're resetting your password (this might be called password recovery settings).
<br>
>Step 3
#Other account permissions

Also look at the settings for the synchronisation to your phone, permissions to applications or other account permissions.


## Deal with being locked out of your account
If you cannot log into your account, use the password reset or recovery link.
<br>
Some providers will send a link to change your password to your recovery email address, while other platforms reset it to your last password.
<br>
If these steps do not work and your account is being abused, contact the platform provider directly. Most providers have a "Support" page where you can find out how to do this.
<br>
There are a number of organisations who can help you with this process [link]
