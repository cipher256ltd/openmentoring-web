# Account Hijacking
## Learn
For some platforms (e.g. Facebook, Gmail), it is possible to review conneciton history and account activity.
<br>
Check to see if your account was accessed at a time when you were not online or if your account was accessed from an unfamiliar location or IP address. 
<br>
Be mindful that if you are using the Tor browser or a VPN service, it is possible that the location or IP address may differ from the location you have accessed the platform.


## Learn
Should you suspect your account has been hijacked, the first step you should take is mitigating the problem. Select the link that best describes your current situation:
- [I still have access to the account]((en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/2-account-hijacked/3-2-learn.md))
- [I no longer have access to the account](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/2-account-hijacked/3-3-learn.md)


## Learn
If you still have access to the account, move to a different computer that you believe to be safe or uncompromised and take the following steps:
<br>
Step 1. Log in to your account from the new computer and change the password on your account.
<br>
Step 2. Once you have changed your password, stop using this account for sharing of sensitive information until you better understand the situation.

## Learn
If you no longer have access to the account, different providers have different recovery procedures or ways to rest passwords.
<br>
Some providers will send a link to change your password to your recovery email address, while other platforms reset it to your last password.
<br>
In the reset case, it is important to change the password immediately after regaining access to your account.
<br>
If these steps do not work and your account is being abused, contact the platform provider directly. Alternatively, contact the following organisations for possible support in shutting the account down.
