## How to mitigate a DDOS attack
**Billing problem**
Make sure your billing information is up to date and that there is no outstanding balance on your hosting services or your domain name to ensure your website is not taken down for billing problems.

## What is a DDOS attack?
![](recap.png)

A threat faced by many independent journalists, news sites and bloggers is having their voices muted because their website is down or defaced.
<br>
In many cases, this maybe an innocent and frustrating problem, but on occasion, it may be due to a distributed ‘denial of service’ attack or a website takeover.
<br>
If your site is under a denial of service attack, we suggest some immediate options for next steps.


## Possible other reasons you may be suffering from a down or defaced website

To start, it is important to know that there are many reasons why your website can be down. Most often this is due to programming errors or technical problems at the company that hosts the site.

## First steps to take if your website is down or defaced

## What to do if you are suffering from a website defacement

## Learn
**Hosting problem**
If your website is not loading at all, your hosting company may be having problems.
<br>
Visit the website of your hosting company and look for a 'status' blog, or search on Twitter.com for other users also discussing downtime with the same host.

## Learn
**Censorship problem**
Can you visit other sites with similar content to your site? Try visiting websites related to yours or covering similar issues.
<br>
Also try using Tor or Psiphon to access your site. If this helps, you have a blocking problem – you are still online for other parts of the world, but are being censored in your own country.
