# DDOS Attack
## First steps to take if your website is down or defaced
**Network problem**
To see whether your web host is working but your website is unavailable, visit https://www.isup.me/.
<br>
If your site is up but you cant see it, it might be a network problem. It could also be in indication that your account has been disabled.

## What is a DDOS attack?
![](recap.png)

A threat faced by many independent journalists, news sites and bloggers is having their voices muted because their website is down or defaced.
<br>
In many cases, this maybe an innocent and frustrating problem, but on occasion, it may be due to a distributed ‘denial of service’ attack or a website takeover.
<br>
If your site is under a denial of service attack, we suggest some immediate options for next steps.

**Poor site performance**
Is your site loading intermittently or unusually slowly? Your site may be overwhelmed by the number and speed of requests for pages it is receiving – this is a performance problem.
<br>
This could be ‘good’ if your site has become more popular and simply needs some improvements to respond to more readers. Check your site analytics for a long-term pattern in growth.

## Steps to mitigate a DDOS attack
Step 1: Contact a trusted person who can help with your website (your webmaster, the people who helped you set up your site, your internal staff if you have them and the company that hosts your site).
<br>
Step 2: Work with the company you bought your domain from (like EasyDNS, Network Solutions, GoDaddy) and change the ‘Time to Live’ or TTL to 1 hour.
<br>
This can help you redirect your site much faster once it comes under attack (the default is 72 hours, or three days).
<br>
This setting will often be found in ‘advanced’ properties for your domain, sometimes part of the SRV or Service records.
<br>
Step 3: Move your site to a DDoS mitigation service.  Examples:
-- Deflect.ca
-- Google’s Project Shield
-- CloudFlare’s Project Galileo
<br>
Step 4: As soon as you have regained control, review your needs and decide between a secure hosting provider or simply continuing with your DDoS mitigation service

## Questions for your webmaster
Who built your website? Are they available to help?
<br>
Who is your web hosting provider? This is the company that provides the server where your website lives. If you do not know, you can use a tool like this to help.
<br>
Do you have your account log in details for this hosting provider?
<br>
Where did you purchase your domain name? In some cases this is also your website host, but it could also be another company.
<br>
Do you have the log in details for the domain name service? If not, finding these is your first step to recovering your site
<br>
Who else knows or may have access to these account details?
<br>
After answering these questions, [take the following steps](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/5-ddos/3-11-learn.md) to mitigate the problem.

## Possible other reasons you may be suffering from a down or defaced website
![](recap.png)

To start, it is important to know that there are many reasons why your website can be down. Most often this is due to programming errors or technical problems at the company that hosts the site.
<br>
Sometimes, other things like legal challenges can cause a host to turn a site off as well. Before you conclude you are the victim of a DDOS attack, root out the following potential problems:

## How to mitigate a DDOS attack
**Billing problem**
Make sure your billing information is up to date and that there is no outstanding balance on your hosting services or your domain name to ensure your website is not taken down for billing problems.

## What to do if you are suffering from a website defacement
**Legal problems**
If your website is taken down due to a legal issue, the resources provided by [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://ssd.eff.org/), while focused on US copyright laws, are a good place to learn more.

## Learn
**Hosting problem**
If your website is not loading at all, your hosting company may be having problems.
<br>
Visit the website of your hosting company and look for a 'status' blog, or search on Twitter.com for other users also discussing downtime with the same host.

## Learn
**Censorship problem**
Can you visit other sites with similar content to your site? Try visiting websites related to yours or covering similar issues.
<br>
Also try using Tor or Psiphon to access your site. If this helps, you have a blocking problem – you are still online for other parts of the world, but are being censored in your own country.

## Learn
**Software problem**
Are you seeing error messages? This could be a software problem.
<br>
Think about any recent changes you or your team may have made and contact your webmaster.
<br>
Sending your webmaster a screenshot, the link of the page you are having problems with and any error messages you see will help them figure out what might be causing the problem.
<br>
Here are some [helpful questions]() to ask your webmaster


## Learn
**Account hijacking**
Are you seeing a website that is not yours? Are you receiving a warning from your browser about malware on your own site? This could be a defacement problem.
<br>
See [website defacement]() for next steps. you will need to work with your web hosting provider and review the Account Hijacking section.
