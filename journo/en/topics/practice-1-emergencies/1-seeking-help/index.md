## Unencrypted channels
As a general rule, it is important to understand that most ‘normal’ communications tools are not very secure against eavesdropping.
<br>
Mobile and landline phone communication is not encrypted and can be listened to by governments, law enforcement agencies, or other parties with the necessary technical equipment.
<br>
Sending unencrypted communication is like sending a postcard, anyone who has access to the postcard can read the message.

## Encrypted channels
Sending encrypted communication is like placing the postcard inside a safe and then sending the safe, which only you and those you trust know the combination to and are able to open and read the message.
<br>
Secure communication is always a trade-off between security and convenience. Choosing the most appropriate form of secure communication will depend on your unique situation and the activities in which you are involved.
<br>
A communication tool that provides end-to-end encryption is recommended. PGP-encrypted email, or chat with OTR or Signal on your phone encrypt messages "all the way" (between you and your recipient).
<br>
If an end-to-end encrypted tool is not available, use tools that encrypt message only between you and the provider. Such as Gmail, Facebook, or Twitter which all use HTTPS.
<br>
This, in turn, is better than using unencrypted communications (such as a postcard, your phone or text messages). Do the best that you can with the resources and skills available.
<br>
To learn more about communicating safely on a computer, refer to the [Safe Emailing](link needed here!) section.
To learn more about communicating safely on a smartphone, refer to the [Safe Phones](en/topics/practice-3-safe-phones/0-getting-started/1-intro.md)section.

## Establishing trust when reaching out
Whether you are helping someone remotely or seeking help from a third party, establishing trust is very important.
<br>
It might be safer to presume that an adversary may have access to all your account details as well as your communications when seeking help and might be attempting to provide specific, bad advice.
<br>
If you know the party you're reaching out to, using a video call or a phone call will help establish that you're really in contact with them.
<br>
When you are initiating contact with third parties you might want to create a new email account from a trusted device. If possible, do not rely on unknown people you find online.
<br>

> have a video chat.


## Dealing with insecure channels
Start with the most secure form of communication you can manage and the person you reach out to may be able to help you establish a line of communications that is more secure, if necessary.
<br>
In many cases, it is better to reach out for help insecurely than not to reach out for help at all. You might want to share only limited information or use code words when you know that the channel is insecure.
<br>
If you believe that you cannot trust your computer or device you might want to find an alternate trustworthy device. You might also want to go to the [Malware](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/4-malware/1-intro.md) lesson.

## Introduction
![](unit.png)

Establish secure communications when reaching out for help.


## Scenario
![](scenario.png)

Isaac is worried that his computer might have been hacked into. He wants to reach out to his friend Brenda who he thinks can advise her.
<br>
![](scenario.png)

But Isaac thinks that he might be at risk if he reveals too much about his situation, or worse, that he could put Brenda herself at risk if he doesn't use secure communications to reach out to her.

Secure communication is always a trade-off between security and convenience. 
<br>
Choosing the most appropriate form of secure communication will depend on your unique situation, your threat model and the activities in which you are involved.
<br>
When communicating there are different levels of security. This section focuses on protecting the content of your communications. You can read more about [protecting the identity](5-learn-identity.md) of the participants.
<br>
A communication tool that provides end-to-end encryption (such a PGP-encrypted email, or chat with OTR or Textsecure on your phone) is better than using a tool with transport-layer encryption (such as Gmail, Facebook, or Twitter).

<br>
When communicating there are different levels of security. This section focuses on protecting the identity of your communication participants. You can read more about what to do if you are under [targeted threat](5-learn-targeted.md).
<br>
Anonymisation tools hide the sender and recipient of a message and will protect the identity of the participants in a communication.
<br>
Examples of anonymisation tools are [tor](en/topics/tool-4-tor/0-getting-started/index.md), or [orbot](en/topics/tool-5-orbot/0-getting-started/index.md) on your phone.

<br>
When communicating there are different levels of security. This section focuses on protecting against active targeting of yourself or your communications.
<br>
If you are actively surveilled, you need to focus on many more aspects regarding your safety and the safety of the people you communicate with.
<br>
Depending on how advanced your digital security and operational security practices are, you might need to consider that your communications are compromised.
<br>
In this case you have to consider the consequence for yourself and your contact to reveal information about the emergency. 
<br>
If you have prepared [an emergency plan with your contacts](en/topics/practice-2-planning/4-emergency-plan/index.md) you can use pre-agreed signals to trigger an emergency plan.

        <p>With end-to-end encryption the company providing the service is able to read my content.</p>
        <answer>Yes</answer>
        <answer correct>No</answer>
        <explanation>End-to-end encryption means that only you and the person you're communicating with have the encryption keys. If the keys are not available to anyone else, then no one can eavesdrop on your communications.</explanation>

    <question>
        <p>With transport layer encryption the company providing the service is able to read my content.</p>
        <answer correct>Yes</answer>
        <answer>No</answer>
        <explanation>With transport-layer encryption (HTTPS), the communication is encrypted between you and the company's server. In other words, it's the internet company that is providing the encryption and they have the encryption keys. In the end-to-end case you and the person you're communicating with are providing the encryption.</explanation>
