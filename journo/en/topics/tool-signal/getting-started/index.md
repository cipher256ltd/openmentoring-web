<p>As Signal can securely store your SMS messages, so it is recommended that you import the messages from your current SMS app.</p>

<h3 id="making-signal-the-default-message-app">Making Signal the Default Message App</h3>
<p>After your old messages have been imported you should make Signal the default SMS application so that all messages you receive appear in it and not the old application. This can be done by tapping <img src="https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/012.png" alt=""> when prompted.</p>

<h3 id="encrypted-storage">Encrypted Storage</h3>
<p>Signal also allows you to store all your messages in an encrypted container protected by a passphrase, so if someone gains access to your phone, they will not be able to access your messages when Signal is locked. After a set period of time, if you have not looked at any messages, Signal will automatically lock and you will have to enter your passphrase the next time you want to read your messages.</p>
