### Importing Messages

Signal can securely store your SMS messages, so it is recommended that you import the messages from your current SMS app. To do this, take the following steps:
<br>
Step 1: After registration is complete, Signal will open and you will be asked if you want to import your messages from the default SMS app on your phone. Press ![](https://securityinabox.org/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/012.png)

Once the import is complete you can access all your old messages in Signal and you should delete them from your other application.

### Encrypted Storage

Signal also allows you to store all your messages in an encrypted container protected by a passphrase, so if someone gains access to your phone, they will not be able to access your messages when Signal is locked.
