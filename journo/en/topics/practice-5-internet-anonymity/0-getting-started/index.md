Henry and Grace are journalists in a Kampala suburb who mantain a blog on which they anonymously publicise corruption practices and campaign for political change.

The authorities in Uganda have not been able to shut down their website, because it is hosted in another country, but they have often tried to learn the identity of the blog's administrators from other journalists.
