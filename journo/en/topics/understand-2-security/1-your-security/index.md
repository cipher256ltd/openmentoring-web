## Introduction
Journalists often work on stories that may expose them to risk of physical or other forms of harm.
<br>
This unit will provide an overview of thinking about security in terms of yourself. Much of the information is drawn from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists [Journalist Security Guide](https://cpj.org/reports/2012/04/journalist-security-guide.php)


## Scenario
Lisa is starting a new story about corruption in the gold mining industry, and wants to speak with a number of stakeholder involved.
<br>
Before making plans to meet, however, she makes sure she has told colleagues of her plans and the time and location of her meeting, as well as chosen to meet the stakeholders in a public space.
<br>
After the meeting, Lisa again contacts her colleagues to inform them that she is safe.

## Learn
Your security and well being are always more important than a story. To mimise potential risks, it is important to prepare a security assessment before taking on a potentially dangerous story.
<br>
This assessment should identify contact people and the time and means of communication; describe all known hazards, including the history of problems in the reporting area; and outline contingency plans that address the perceived risks.
<br>
Diverse sources should be consulted, including journalists with experience in the location or topic, diplomatic advisories, reports on press freedom and human rights, and academic research.
<br>
Editors working with staffers or freelancers should have substantial input into the assessment, take the initiative in raising security questions, and receive a copy of the assessment.
<br>
An independent journalist working without a relationship with a news organization must be especially rigorous in compiling a security assessment, consulting with peers, researching the risks, and arranging a contact network.
