## Introduction
Journalists often work on stories that may expose them to risk of physical or other forms of harm.
<br>
This unit will provide an overview of thinking about security in terms of yourself. Much of the information is drawn from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists [Journalist Security Guide](https://cpj.org/reports/2012/04/journalist-security-guide.php)

Your security and well being are always more important than a story. To mimise potential risks, it is important to prepare a security assessment before taking on a potentially dangerous story.
<br>
This assessment should identify contact people and the time and means of communication; describe all known hazards, including the history of problems in the reporting area; and outline contingency plans that address the perceived risks.
<br>
Diverse sources should be consulted, including journalists with experience in the location or topic, diplomatic advisories, reports on press freedom and human rights, and academic research.
<br>
Editors working with staffers or freelancers should have substantial input into the assessment, take the initiative in raising security questions, and receive a copy of the assessment.
<br>
An independent journalist working without a relationship with a news organization must be especially rigorous in compiling a security assessment, consulting with peers, researching the risks, and arranging a contact network.
<br>
For more information on conducting a risk assessment, refer to the [Planning and Preparing](en/topics/practice-2-planning/0-getting-started/1-intro.md) section of this guide.
