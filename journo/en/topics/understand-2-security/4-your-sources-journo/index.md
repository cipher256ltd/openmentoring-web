## Learn
Protecting sources is a cornerstone of journalism. This is especially important when covering topics such as violent crime, national security, and armed conflict, in which sources could be put at legal or physical risk.
<br>
Citizen journalists and freelance journalists, in particular, need to know that this burden rests primarily with them, although in some countries, journalists working for established media houses also face risks.
<br>
You should never promise a source that you can keep their identity confidential until you weight posible consequences of doing so. Oftentimes, media houses require journalists to provide the editor with the name of sources, however this is not always the case.
<br>
In some nations, local journalists covering organized crime, national security, or armed conflict are especially vulnerable to imprisonment, torture, coercion, or attack related to the use of confidential information.
<br>
In order to protect both you and your sources, it is important consider when and how to contact your sources, whether to call them on a landline or cell phone, whether to visit them in their office or home, and whether to use open or secure email or chat message.
<br>
Consider using simple code or pseudonyms to hide your sourceâ€™s identity in written or electronic files. Instructions on physically securing written files, securing electronic files through encryption and other methods are described in other sections of this toolkt.
