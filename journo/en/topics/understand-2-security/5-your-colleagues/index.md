## Sharing of information with your teams
It's important to think about what kinds of information you share with your colleagues and what information to keep private.
<br>
Sharing information with your colleagues about your sources and research means that they will be able to continue your important investigations should something unexpected arise.
<br>
On the other hand, sharing information only on a 'need to know' basis means you might be better able to prevent infiltration by adversaries.
<br>
Whether you share much or little information with your colleagues, it is important that all information shared is done so securely.
<br>
Refer to the [Secure Communications](en/topics/understand-4-digisec/4-secure-communications/1-1-intro.md) and [Operational Security](en/topics/understand-3-opsec/0-getting-started/1-1-intro.md) lessons to learn how to do do so.


## Talking about security with your colleagues
Talking about security is courageous. Failing to talk about security, or or pretending risks do not exist, promotes a culture of carelessness.
<br>
Sometimes, though, it can be hard to talk about security with your colleagues.
<br>
You might face opposition from those who feel talking about security takes away valuable time you could spend doing your jobs. Your colleagues might even put on a brave face and pretending these risks do not exist.
<br>
It's also possible you might feel this way yourself.
<br>
When you or other people bring it up, it is important not to take this as a weakness or a worry, but as an opportunity to develop and make sure everyone is on the same page.
<br>
To learn how to develop security with your colleagues, refer to the [Operational Security](en/topics/understand-3-opsec/0-getting-started/1-1-intro.md) and the [Planning and Preparing](en/topics/practice-2-planning/0-getting-started/1-1-intro.md) lessons.
