## Why choosing a strong password is important
Passwords are often the first and only barrier between your informatio and anyone who might want to read, use, or destroy it without your mission
<br>
Passwords are important for both online security and privacy. Bad passwords can easily nullify most of your other efforts.
<br>
In general, when you want to protect something - whther a house or an email account - you lock it up with a key.
<br>
All keys, physical and electronic, have one thing in common: they open their locks just as effectively in the hands of somebody else.
<br>
You can use the most advanced security tools, but if your password is week, or if you allow it to fall into the wrong hands, they will not do you any good.
<br>
Here is some basic advice on choosing passwords:
- Don’t use the same password across devices.
- Don’t use your name or account in the password.
- Don’t use common passwords (e.g., “12345,” family names).
<br>
##Strong passwords
A password should be difficult for a computer program to guess, difficult for others to figure out, and should be chosen so as to minimise damage if someone does learn it.
<br>
Here are some tips on making a strong password
<br>
**Make it long:** The longer a passwrod is, the longer it takes to guess it. Use more than ten characters or ideally a long phrase or sentence. Short passwords of any kind, even totally random ones, are not strong enough for use with encryption today.
<br>
**Make it complex:** Strong passwords are long and include a combination of lower- and uppercase letters, numbers and special characters; their strength increases with length and complexity.
<br>
**Dont' make it personal:** Don't choose a word or phrase based on information suchas you name, telephone number, child's name, pet's name, birth date, or anything else that a person could easily learn by doing a little research about you.
<br>
**Keep it secret:** Don't share your password with anybody unless absolutely necessary! If you must share a password with a family member or colleague, you should change it to a temporary password first, share that one, then change it back when they are done using it.
<br>
**Keep it unique:** Don’t use the same password across devices or for multiple accounts. Otherwise anyone who learns that password will be able to access all accounts with the same password
<br>
**Keep it fresh:** It's important to change your passwords regularly, regardless of how strong of a password you have. We recommend you change your password at least once every three months.
<br>
**Make it memorable:** Password patterns can allow you to use very different but related phrases for all of your accounts, basing one off of the other. For example, if you use your mother’s birthday, you could use your dad’s, brother’s, grandmother’s or dog’s for other accounts.
<br>
Repeating patterns will make your passwords easy to remember, though it can put you at risk if an adversary gains access to multiple passwords and recognizes the patterns. And, of course, any pattern model becomes ineffective as soon as it is written or suggested anywhere online (so never use the one we just suggested).
<br>
**Use a password manager:** We recommend you use a password manager to keep track of passwords that are long and complex enough to be adequately secure. A secure password database, such as KeypassX, is a helpful tool for managing passwords for multiple accounts.
<br>
Password managers are considered to be the most secure way to use complex and varying passwords and still remember them. KeePassX is an open-source password manager, and once you've set your master password, it creates and saves passwords for you.
<br>
To enhance convenience, you can synchronise your password database - for example, by using a cloud service, so that you can access your passwords on various computers as well as your phone. That way, you'll have round the clock access to strong passwords.
<br>
##Testing password strength
To test your password, you can play around with the “How secure is my password?” tool. This site will calculate how quickly a desktop PC could crack your password. “Hello12,” for example, would take about 19 seconds.
<br>
But caution: after you enter your password into this public site, it might not be a bad idea to change it. And if you really believe that you are up against advanced adversaries, keep in mind that they’ll have much more computing power than a normal desktop PC.
<br>
##Two-factor authentication
We recommend you take advantage of online services that offer two-factor authentication. These programs require not only a password, but also, say, a code sent to you in a text message.
<br>
You input the code to verify that you are indeed the person trying to access the account. Google, Twitter and Dropbox were the first to offer this procedure. However now, the practice is widespread in common service providers.

If you want to be serious about passwords, you should consider getting a password manager, which is considered to be the most secure way to use complex and varying passwords and still remember them. KeePassX is an open-source password manager, and once you’ve set your master password, it creates and saves passwords for you. To enhance convenience, you can synchronize your password database – for example, by using a cloud service, so that you have access on various computers as well as your phone. That way, you’ll have ’round-the-clock access to strong passwords.

Alternative password managers include LastPass, 1Password and the recently developed, open-source Encryptr. Depending on your environment, you can also consider breaking one of the most basic rules: write it down. By this, we don’t mean, “Write it down and pin it to your computer.” But unless you believe that somebody will break into your room to filch your password, why not write it down on a sheet of paper and slip it into a random folder? If you don’t write it down, you may be wary of choosing a highly secure password, for fear of forgetting it.

If you don’t want to use a password manager, but you’re interested in strengthening your passwords, check out these detailed tactics and background information.

For passwords that don’t protect your most important assets, you can develop your own password algorithm, or a logic by which you invent passwords that only you can follow. The goal is to be cryptic to everyone but you, using patterns, repetition and ideas particular to you.

To create a strong password that is nevertheless easy to remember, you could take ideas that you know well, such as your mother’s name (let’s call her Alice), her birthday (let’s make it November 3, 1955) and her favorite color (let’s make it green) to create the following: 03_Alice_11_Green_55. If you throw in some special characters, the password would become even harder to crack: 03_Alice?_11_Green!_55.

On the topic of special characters: be aware that most hackers or password-cracking tools know full well that many people replace “a” with “@” and “e” with “3.”

Password patterns can allow you to use very different but related phrases for all of your accounts, basing one off of the other. For example, if you use your mother’s birthday, you could use your dad’s, brother’s, grandmother’s or dog’s for other accounts.
