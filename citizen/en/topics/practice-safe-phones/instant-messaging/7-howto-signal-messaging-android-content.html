<h2 id="-1-sending-and-receiving-messages-"><strong>[1] Sending and Receiving messages</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To send encrypted messages to your contacts, they must also have Signal installed, otherwise the message will be sent as an insecure SMS.</p>
<p>Signal can send messages as SMS using your mobile phone company to relay the message. With this option, even if your recipient is using Signal and the SMS is encrypted, your mobile phone company will know that you are sending a (encrypted) message to this particular recipient. </p>
<p>If your phone is connected to the Internet, either using a data connection offered by your mobile phone company or using local wifi, Signal will instead send the message over an encrypted connection with a WhisperSync server. In this instance, your mobile phone company will not know who you are sending your messages to.</p>
<h2 id="-2-messaging-individuals-"><strong>[2] Messaging Individuals</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Signal and tap at the top of your screen to bring up your contact list.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on the contact you wish to message.</p>
<p>Note: The contact list will display at the top all your contacts who also use Signal (under the Signal Users heading) and then your full contact list (including Signal users) in the All Contacts section.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Compose your message in the box and tap to send.</p>
<p>Note If you send a message to another Signal user and you are connected to the Internet, the default option is to send it via Internet. If you want to send an encrypted SMS (using your mobile phone company) or an insecure SMS instead of an encrypted message long press to bring up the alternative sending options.</p>
