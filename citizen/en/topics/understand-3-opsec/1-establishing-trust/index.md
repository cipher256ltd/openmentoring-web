## Learn
# "Be careful with each other..."
The old activist motto "Be careful with each other, so that we can be dangerous together‚Äù has a lot to do with trust.
<br>
# Productivity and security
Trusting your team is important both your organisations productivity and overall security. Building  trust  within  a  team  is  not  a  trivial  task - it  involves  investment  and  taking risks.
<br>
# Trying new tactics
Trust allows for trying new organisational security tactics, especially if you could not be, or were not involved in making decisions about it before.
<br>
# Sharing mistakes
It also creates an atmosphere of openness where you feel more comfortable sharing your security incidents, information you feel is important, and also your mistakes.
<br>
# Increased confidence
Trust gives team members confidence to know whom to talk to about which aspects of security.


## Learn
# Increasing trust in a team
There are several ways we can work on increasing trust within a team:
<br>
# Getting to knew each other
- Getting  to  know  each  other  outside  the  professional  or  activist  context,  e.g. through out-of-work activities, socialising and having fun.
<br>
# Checking on well-being of others
- Check in regularly (e.g. before a meeting) on  your team's  stress levels, general mood, and what they are bringing to their activism from their personal lives.
<br>
# Organisational Transparency
- Transparency about hierarchies and decision-making structures.
<br>
# Clear security strategies
- Clear strategies for how to deal with personal or sensitive issues that may arise including (but not limited to) security incidents, threats and so on.
<br>
# Access to a counsellor
- Having access to a counsellor or trusted psychologist.
<br>
# Trust in managing information
Aside from trust in one another, we can also build trust in our strategies for managing sensitive information, clear channels and create means for communication about it.
