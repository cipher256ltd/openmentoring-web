# Devices Seized
## Identify security protections
![](recap.png)
Strong security protection such as full disk encryption means that sensitive information on a missing device is less likely to get into the wrong hands. We recommend using full disk encryption and protecting devices with passwords whenever possible.
<br>
Failing this, password
## give intro and say what to do depending on results of questions.

<br>
Was the device protected by a password or other security measures?
<br>
Which operating system was running on the device? Was this a legal version, or was it an illegal, jailbroken or rooted version?
<br>

<br>
Do you have remote access to the device?


## Assess the situation
![](recap.png)
Its helpful
<br>
How was your device ?
<br>
## subsection on human component, people being comproimised as result of having device seized. what are assets that can be compromising to people and work out a way to let them know.

What sort of device are you missing? A computer, mobile phone, tablet or an external hard drive?
<br>
When and where did you lose the device?
<br>
How did you lose the device? Was it stolen by another person, taken by a state authority or did you simply lose track of it?
<br>
Is the device still missing?


## Have people been compromised?
![](recap.png)
Sometimes having a device seized means that people have been compromised as a result of sensitive information getting in the wrong hands.
<br>
Think about what assets you have that can be compromising to people and work out a way to let them know. Do this as securely as possible, as explained in the [Secure Communications](en/topics/understand-4-digisec/4-secure-communications) lesson.


## What was on the missing device
![](recap.png)

Make an inventory of the different types of sensitive information that was on your device. Examples include email, chat history, social media, contacts (email, Skype, chat, etc.), files, location data, credit card data and more. This will help you learn what may have been exposed or stolen.
<br>
Did you use encryption tools for email or chat (such as PGP and OTR)? This will help you learn if your information is secure or not.
<br>
Did you use full disk encryption on the device? This will help you to learn if files on your computer containing sensitive information is secure or not.
<br>
What accounts does this device have access to? Examples include email, social media, chat, IM and banking accounts that the device can access. Is the device used for secondary authentication? This will help you determine which accounts you need to change account settings for.
<br>
Do your accounts have saved passwords or automatically log in when you turn your device on? This is common for email, Skype and other chat programs, or if you save your passwords in your web browser instead of a password manager like KeePassX. If you do, be sure to change you passwords immediately.


## Deal with the problem
![](recap.png)

If your device is still missing take the following four steps:
<br>
Step 1: When your device has access to accounts (email, social media or web account) remove the authorization for this device for all accounts. This can be done by going to your accounts online and changing the account permissions.
<br>
Step 2: Change the passwords for all accounts that are accessible by this device. To learn more about doing this, refer to the [Account Hijacked](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/2-account-hijacked/1-1-intro.md) section.
<br>
Step 3: Turn on 2-factor authentication for all accounts that were accessible by this device. Please note that not all accounts support 2-factor authentication.
<br>
Step 4: If you have a tool installed on your lost devices that allows you to erase the data and the history of your device, use it.


## If you get the device back
![](recap.png)
Be careful as you do not know who has had access to your device. Possibly treat the device as if it is now untrusted or compromised.
<br>
Ask yourself the following 4 questions and assess the risk that your device has been compromised:
<br>
1. How long was the device out of your sight?
<br>
2. Who potentially could have had access to it?
<br>
3. Why would they want access to it?
<br>
4. Are there signs that the device has been physically tampered with?
<br>
If you have lost contact with your device for a long time and you feel there is a chance that something has been installed on it, please consider the following:
<br>
Computer: reinstall the OS from scratch and recover all documents from the last backup and scan all your documents and files with antivirus software. For more guidance on this, see the the [malware section](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/4-malware/1-1-intro.md).
<br>
Phones and tablets: Depending on your level of risk and how your device was taken, you may not want to use it again. If possible, move all of the data off of your phone or tables and purchase a new one.
<br>
If you cannot change devices but suspect it might be compromised, do not use your phone or tablet for sensitive communication or opening sensitive files. Do not take it to sensitive meetings or have it with you when discussing sensitive topics.

## Scenario
![](scenario.png)

Brenda returned to her office, only to find her laptop missing. She is worried that her laptop contains information that could put her sources at risk.
<br>
![](scenario.png)

She needs to know what was on the device before it went missing and what security protections were in place. Brenda is worried that if she doesn't have a clear view of the damage done, she isn't able to start recovering.
