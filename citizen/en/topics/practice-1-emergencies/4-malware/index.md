## What is malware?
Malware exploits access to your device to send out spam, seize banking, email or social media credentials, shut down websites and collect vital information from journalists, human rights defenders, NGOs, activists and bloggers.
<br>
Malware works by installing itself on your device when you open a link to a malicious website or open an infected file you have downloaded. After it is installed on your device, it can record keystrokes, steal passwords, take screenshots, record audio, video and more.
<br>
Malware is dangerous software that allows an unauthorized takeover of your device by another user. It can be used by the government or a third party to surveil you.
<br>
While most malware is designed for and utilized by criminals, people working directly or indirectly for governments have increasingly adopted malware as a tool for surveillance, espionage and sabotage.
<br>
With malware, the important thing you can do is prepare. Refer to the [Planning and Preparing](en/topics/practice-2-planning/0-getting-started/1-1-intro.md) unit to learn more about computer hygiene and developing emergency plans.

## Determining whether you might have malware
# 1. Malicious attachment or link
You opened an attachment or link that you think may have been malicious. Links or attachments are often the cause of malware infections.
<br>
# 2. Webcam LED turns on when you are not using it
 Your webcam LED turns on when you are not using the webcam. This may indicate your device is being accessed remotely.
<br>
# 3. Accounts have been compromised multiple times.
Your accounts have been compromised multiple times, even after you have changed the password. This may indicate someone has control of your device.
<br>
# 4. Device seized and returned
Your device was seized and then returned. It is possible that your device may have been infected with malware when it was taken from you.
<br>
# 5. Device tampered
 Someone broke into your home and may have tampered with your device. This may indicate that your device was infected with malware during the break in.
<br>
# 6. Personal data made public
 Some of your personal data has been made public and it could only come from your personal computer. This may indicate that someone has access to your computer.
<br>
# 7. Targeting by state
 Your group is being targeted by a government, law enforcement, or an actor with equivalent capabilities.

## Letting the attack play out
Finding out what has happened to you and who has targeted you may be more important than 'cleaning' your computer. It can be very valuable to gain an understanding of your adversary through letting the attack play out.
<br>  
If understanding the attacker and the attack is important to you, you must collect and analyse information when a potential malware infection happens. Do this before ‘cleaning’ your computer.
<br>
Keep in mind that counter-surveillance is a big investment and is not easy. It might be taken as
> bring in more from umbrella counter surveillance - physical. impliactions of counter surveillance...big investment. not easy.
make a simple statement about overt and covert surveillance - benefits and risks of doing both .
1. don't reveal by electornic communications or physical behaviour you think you're being watched
2. move activities to a safe computer - direct to seeking help.
3. work on a strategy on dealing with this, knowing that it can be taken....doing this might be perceived as an escalation. weigh pros and cons - direct people to risk analysis

## Stop using your device
There is no quick fix to clean up malware from you computer. [Anti-virus software](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/4-malware/3-9-learn.md) may be good at protecting your device from common viruses, but it is mostly ineffective against sophisticated attackers.
<br>
If you believe you are being targeted, disconnect your device from the internet, turn it off, unplug it, remove the battery from your device and seek the help of a trusted security professional. Refer to your [Emergency Plans](en/topics/practice-2-planning/4-emergency-plan/1-1-intro.md).
