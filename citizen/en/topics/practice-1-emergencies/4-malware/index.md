# Malware
## Anti-virus software
Anti-virus software can be an effective first response to protecting a device from a significant percentage of malware.
<br>
But it is generally considered ineffective against targeted attacks, especially by state-sponsored actors.
<br>
We recommend using anti-virus software as it remains a valuable defensive tool against non-targeted, but still dangerous, malware.


## What is malware?
Malware is malicious software that allows an unauthorized takeover of your device by another user. It can be used by the government or a third party to surveil you.
<br>
Malware functions by recording keystrokes, stealing passwords, taking screenshots, recording audio, video and more.
<br>
While most malware is designed for and utilized by criminals, state-sponsored actors have increasingly adopted malware as a tool for surveillance, espionage and sabotage.
<br>
Malware exploits access to your device to send out spam, seize banking, email or social media credentials, shut down websites and collect vital information from journalists, human rights defenders, NGOs, activists and bloggers.
<br>
If you suspect a malware infection on your device here are some things you can do:


## Determining whether you might have malware
Before you assume malware may be at play with your device, be sure to first determine your account has not been hijacked. Refer first to the section on [Account Hijacking](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/2-account-hijacked/1-intro.md).
<br>
After you have determined that account hijacking is not at play, come up with a list of indicators of compromise.

## Indicators of compromise
This term, 'indicators of compromise,' may include the following:
<br>
You opened an attachment or link that you think may have been malicious
<br>
Your webcam LED turns on when you are not using the webcam
<br>
Your accounts have been compromised multiple times, even after you have changed the password
<br>
Your device was seized and then returned
<br>
Someone broke into your home and may have tampered with your device
<br>
Some of your personal data has been made public and it could only come from your personal computer
<br>
Your group is being targeted by a government, law enforcement, or an actor with equivalent capabilities
<br>
If you have answered 'yes' to any of these questions to determine there are clear indicators of compromise and also confirming that you are not victim to an account hijacking, you can do two things:
<br>1) clean your devices
<br>2) understand the attack and then clean your devices.



## Recommended anti-virus software
- Microsoft Safety Scanner (Windows)
- F-Secure
- Kaspersky
- ClamXav (Mac OS X)
- TrendMicro
- ClamAV (Windows and Linux)


## Using anti-virus software
When you run anti-virus software, ensure that it is up to date.
<br>
If a virus is detected the following four steps are recommended.
<br>
Step 1: Ensure that your anti-virus software is up to date
<br>
Step 2: Take a screenshot of the message
<br>
Step 3: Continue with the recommended steps to remove the virus
<br>
Step 4: Following the guidelines in the Safer Communication section above, send the screenshot to a person with security expertise


## Understand the attack
Your first priority may be to get your computer ‘clean’ and usable again. Finding out what has happened to you and who has targeted you may be less important to you.
<br>
But it can be very valuable to gain understanding of your adversary. To learn their technical capabilities and whether or not the potential attacker is known to use surveillance technology.
<br>
If understanding the attacker and the attack is relevant to you, you must collect and analyse information when a potential malware infection happens. Do this before ‘cleaning’ your computer.


If you chose to clean your device without understanding the malware and attack first, please keep the following in mind:
<br>
There is no quick fix to clean up malware from you computer. A sophisticated malware infection may never go away.
<br>
If you believe you are being targeted by a state actor and indicators of compromise persist after using anti-virus software, disconnect the device from the internet, turn it off, unplug it, if possible remove its battery and seek the help of a security professional.
