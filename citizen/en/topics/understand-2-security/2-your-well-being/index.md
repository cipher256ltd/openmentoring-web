##What is of chronic stress?
Chronic stress occurs regularly among journalists and human rights defenders, yet often goes unrecognised or unreported.
<br>
With healthy levels of stress, symptoms are generally mild and temporary - people return to functioning when the stress factor is removed.
<br>
If exposure to stress is excessive or long-term however, symptoms can persist and multiply, resulting in chronic or cumulative stress. 
<br>
Not only is this worse for the body physically and mentally, but chronic stress can also erode coping mechanisms. 
<br>
Chronic stress builds slowly and may be hard to notice in yourself or others. If not properly manged, chronic stress can lead to burnout.
