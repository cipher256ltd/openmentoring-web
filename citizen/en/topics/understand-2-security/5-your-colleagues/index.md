## Learn
# Weakest link
As the old adage goes, "A chain is only as strong as it's weakest link." Your security is dependent on the security of your colleagues.
<br>
# Security for all
When developing a security plan with your colleagues, be sure to include people in all roles of your organisation.
<br>
# Positions to include
For journalists, this means developing information and operational security strategies for everyone from a stringer to a driver, from a journalist to an editor.


## Sharing of information
# Information security
Think about what kinds of information you share with your colleagues and what information to keep private.
<br>
# Work continuity
Sharing information with your colleagues about your sources and research means that they will be able to continue your important investigations should something unexpected arise.
<br>
# 'Need to know' basis
On the other hand, sharing information only on a 'need to know' basis means you might be better able to prevent infiltration by adversaries.
<br>
# Sharing security
Whether you share much or little information with your colleagues, it is important that all information shared is done so securely.

## Talking about security with your colleagues
# Security is courageous
Talking about security is courageous. Failing to talk about security, or or pretending risks do not exist, promotes a culture of carelessness.
<br>
# Sometimes hard
Sometimes, though, it can be hard to talk about security with your colleagues.
<br>
# Possible opposition
You might face opposition from those who feel talking about security takes away valuable time you could spend doing your jobs.
<br>
# Putting on a brave face
Your colleagues might even put on a brave face and pretending these risks do not exist. It's also possible you might feel this way yourself.
<br>
# Responsible
When you or other people bring it up, it is important not to take this as a weakness or a worry, but as an opportunity to develop and make sure everyone is on the same page.
